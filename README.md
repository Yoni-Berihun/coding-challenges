## 🎯 Goals
- Solve problems consistently across platforms and custom sets.  
- Document **thought process, optimizations, and lessons learned**.  
- Build a **scalable collection** of solutions organized by platform and difficulty.  
- Strengthen **problem‑solving patterns** for technical interviews.  

---

## 🛠️ How to Use
- Browse by **platform** (LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces) or **custom category**.  
- Check the **notes/** folder for explanations, complexity analysis, and recurring strategies.  
- Each solution includes:
  - Problem statement reference  
  - Approach (brute force → optimized)  
  - Time & space complexity

## 📌 Notes
- Focus is on **custom problems** to explore unique scenarios beyond standard platforms.  
- Solutions are written in multiple languages (Python, C++, Java, etc.) depending on context.  
- This repo is both a **learning journal** and a **portfolio of problem‑solving skills**.
