# 🟡 EASY → MEDIUM ARRAY PROBLEM
# 📄 Problem Statement

# You are given an array of integers.

# Find the second largest distinct element in the array.

# If there is no second largest distinct element, return -1.

# “Distinct” means different values, not positions.

# 📌   Examples
# Example 1
# Input:
# arr = [4, 1, 3, 4, 2]

# Output:
# 3

# Example 2
# Input:
# arr = [5, 5, 5]

# Output:
# -1

# Example 3
# Input:
# arr = [10, 8]

# Output:
# 8

# 🧠 New Concept You’ll Learn

# Tracking two values instead of one

# Handling duplicates

# Careful comparisons

# 🪜 Hint (Very Gentle)

# Keep two variables:

# largest

# second_largest

# Loop through the array

# Update them carefully when you see a number
