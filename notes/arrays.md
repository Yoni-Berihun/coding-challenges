## Detailed Logs

### 2. Sum Divisible By Three
**File:** `custom/arrays/sum_divisible_by_three.py`
**Date:** February 14, 2026

**Key Learnings:**
1.  **Data Structures**: 
    - Solidified understanding of arrays as the fundamental data structure for storing collections of items.
2.  **Iteration**: 
    - Practiced iterating through array elements to perform operations on each item.
3.  **Troubleshooting**: 
    - **Indentation (Again)**: Encountered challenges with Python's indentation rules, specifically when nesting logic inside loops.
    - **Task Execution**: Learned to distinguish between actions that happen *during* the loop versus *after* the loop completes.

### 1. Product Parity
**File:** `custom/arrays/product_parity.py`
**Date:** February 13, 2026
**Time Spent:** ~2 hours

**Key Learnings:**
1.  **Array Initialization**: 
    - Understood how to create arrays/lists in Python.
    - Learned to use `len()` instead of `.__len__`.
2.  **Looping & Logic**: 
    - Practiced iterating through lists to calculate sums and products.
    - Learned how to check for even numbers using `% 2`.
3.  **Syntax & Debugging**: 
    - **Indentation**: Realized the importance of matching indentation levels for `if` statements inside/outside loops.
    - **Persistence**: Spent time debugging specific syntax errors, which reinforced the rules of the language.

*Note: Debugging simple syntax errors is part of the process!*
