### Key Learnings
- **Array Initialization**: Understood the basics of creating arrays and accessing length.
- **Looping mechanics**: Learned how to iterate through lists to aggregate values (sums and products).
- **Indentation pitfalls**: Encountered and resolved issues with Python indentation, specifically keeping logic inside vs. outside loops.
- **Problem Solving**: Learned to check for specific conditions (like even numbers) to determine the output logic effectively.

*Note: Debugging simple syntax errors is part of the process!*
